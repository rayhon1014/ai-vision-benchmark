# AI Vision LLM
How much AI can see and draw? This is one of the most fascinated space that many models are trying to tackle. We have seen so many amazing results out from there. This repo is aim to test them out and see if we can apply what they are capable of in the industry for public usage.

# Test out Llava over Cloudflare Worker AI

This is an example repo to explore using the AI Vision model [Llava](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llava-1.5-7b-hf/) hosted on Cloudflare Workers AI.

This is a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) app hosted on [Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com).
